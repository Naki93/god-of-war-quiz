Using Navigator.push to switch between screens

Building layouts with Column, SizedBox, and Container

## 🧩 Challenges

This was my first time using Flutter and Dart, so I had to get familiar with the syntax.

Understanding state management using setState was tricky at first.

Figuring out how to move from one question to the next and show the score at the end.

My laptop is outdated, so I couldn’t deploy to a device or use an emulator, which made testing a bit harder.
